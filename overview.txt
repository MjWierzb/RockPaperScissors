Rock Paper Scissors Project Overview
===================================

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game designed for the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python certification.

Core Components
---------------
- `RPS.py`: Houses the adaptive `player` strategy that tracks previous moves, infers opponent behavior, and selects counters.
- `RPS_game.py`: Implements the game engine and several built-in opponents, including Quincy, Abbey, Kris, Mrugesh, a human interface, and a random bot.
- `main.py`: Demonstrates the adaptive player by running sample matches and executing the unit tests.
- `test_module.py`: Ensures the adaptive strategy wins at least 60% of games against each built-in opponent.

Key Features
------------
- Adaptive pattern recognition to detect the active opponent.
- Automated simulations and tests for rapid feedback.
- Optional interactive mode for playing against the bots manually.

Usage Highlights
----------------
Run `python main.py` to execute the default simulations and tests, or use `python -m unittest test_module` to run the validation suite directly. You can modify the `player` function in `RPS.py` to experiment with new strategies and benchmark them against the included opponents.
